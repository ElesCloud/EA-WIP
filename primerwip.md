## SECTION ONE: Description and Purpose

This document is a general-level guide on the basics of the Second Life Military Community. It is intended for individuals who are interested in learning about how the community operates.

## SECTION TWO: What exactly is the SLMC?

The Second Life Military Community is a cluster of self-identified combat roleplay groups on Second Life that mutually agree at a minimum to participate in Linden Labs damage combat with each other. The SLMC uses scripted weapons typically designed to deal damage to avatars and return the target to a designated spawn point. The SLMC also designs and employs a variety of gear and technology to make combat more variable and interesting. Each individual group has its own aeshetic and perspective on how things should be done.

The SLMC has a long history (considering it is a digital social platform), that spans back to the early 2000s. Unfortunately, a portion of the individuals in our community are unabashedly toxic and entirely devoid of any concern for anyone but themselves and their own. It is not as bad as it used to be, but the necessity of this warning still remains: if you intend to participate, be aware that you will need a thick skin. People won't care if you're offended.


## SECTION THREE: General Etiquette Do's and Don'ts

There are certain behaviors expected of everyone participating in the Second Life Military Community, whether they are affiliated with a group or not. While the community generally extends grace to newbies at first, failure to comply may have unpleasant consequences. The following is a list of some basic DOs and DON'Ts that apply to the majority of participating groups:

- DO: Set your home. When you enter a combat sim, please join the spawn group and set your home point in the spawn area. 
  - Second Life is poorly optimized and dated software. Because of that, leaving and especially entering a sim can cause what is known as a "rez queue," where bullets, grenades, and other assets cannot be rezzed until the sim is done loading you. This can last from a moment to a few minutes, depending on the avatar and server, and brings combat to a halt. 
  - If you leave and re-enter a sim every time you die, you will likely incur the ire of the group you are visiting.
- DO: Wear clothes. SLMC sims are not sex sims. We don’t want to see genitals, even if you make them invisible. There are plenty of other places on SL to go get your 18+ business on.
- DO: Be aware of escalation. The SLMC is very well armed, but we prefer to use gear similar to what you are using to make for a fair fight. 
  - If you come to fight with a basic assault rifle, most groups will use their basic weapons also. By the same principle, if you bring out a tank, rocket launcher, or heavy machine gun, you can expect similar force used against you. 
- DO: Read the rules. When you enter a combat sim for the first time, take five minutes to grab the rules and read. Even if you are not doing combat, there may be areas that are off limits to visitors or certain attachments that are not permitted. Just read. It isn't hard. You're doing it right now.
- DO: Keep your cool. This is not real life. If you are having a bad time, there is nothing stopping you from leaving. Consider taking a break if you get heated. Remember, thick skin to survive.

- DO NOT: Try to explore while armed. If you are just visiting a group that you are not enlisted in, take off your guns or at least sling them. When you enter, you are being watched. If you appear to be combative, you can expect to be killed.
- DO NOT: Use avatar flight. Avatar flight is disabled in SLMC combat sims. Do not override this unless it is your own sim.
- DO NOT: Cheat. Tactics that grant unfair advantages are unsportsmanlike. Some groups have much more hardline stances on certain client-side assists (see the glossary) than others - your best bet is to consult and become familiar with each group's rules before conducting combat.
- DO NOT: God-mode. This overlaps with cheating. Equipment like auto killers, orbiters, or things you would find in a generic magic HUD on the Marketplace that give you wild abilities aren't welcome here, because the advantages they give are, quite frankly, annoying, and contrary to the spirit of competitive first-person shooting.
- DO NOT: Grief or crash sims. People pay good money to have a sim to do their thing on. If you interrupt people doing their thing, they probably won't like you very much and you might not be welcome there anymore. Or they might grief you back way harder than you bargained on. Either way, it won't go well for you. If you outright crash the sim, this is not only a denial of the service being paid for, which is a shitty thing to do by itself, but it can also roll back hours of work on scripts, avatars, the sim build and more. Sim owners also share information about these events, so a ban may be extended to other regions.


## SECTION FOUR: The Big Four

THE “BIG FOUR”: As mentioned above, some members of the community are incapable of so much as a shred of empathy, courtesy, or civility. However, there are a number of things that go beyond what even the SLMC tolerates. These "Big Four" are as follows:
- Distribution of private, personally identifying information (PII) about others without their consent or knowledge - also called doxxing
- GPU crashing or griefing that is designed to or has the capability to permanently damage a user's real-life PC hardware
- Creative content theft or distribution (ripping, copybotting, etc); any unauthorized use or sharing of another user's creative work
- Abuse of the AR (abuse report) system. This is defined as a bad-faith attempt to provoke a response from Linden Labs in order to get someone's account suspended or banned.
  - It is not considered abuse if there is a legitimate reason to involve LL for actions that go beyond the scope of issues within just our community - for example, harassment or stalking, threats of real-life violence, or a violation of one of the Big Four mentioned above.

The main point to understand is that, while the community permits a very wide range of behavior, we do have a line. We draw that line where the impact reaches beyond Second Life.


## SECTION FIVE: Glossary

The SLMC is connected with the more technical side of Second Life as well as FPS gaming in general. There are some concepts and terms we may take for granted that can look like jargon to the unfamiliar. The following list has been compiled of some of those terms and their meanings:

- **Dodgeroll**: Most groups in the SLMC utilize a type of short scripted movement boost. This a quick dash or roll of no more than 10 meters with a cool-down period in between uses. It is considered a standard feature by most groups.
- **Hard fall**: This is a moment of immobility when you've landed on your face after falling from a sufficient height. Some groups consider the disabling of this to be a client-side assist or cheat.
- **Hitbox**: The physical, normally invisible collision box centered on your avatar position that determines whether or not you take fire and are killed. It is literally box-shaped and unaffected by crouching or limb movement. This hitbox stays under your name tag, even if an animation moves your visible avatar somewhere else. If your AO moves your visible avatar totally out of your hitbox, you may be asked to disable it, as this can be seen as dishonest play. Your hitbox naturally moves slightly ahead of your avatar when you are in motion.
- **LBA**: Listen-Based-Armor is a scripting system that allows objects such as vehicles and barricades to absorb enemy fire and track damage points. It is the modern replacement for old HP/AT systems that relied solely on prims colliding with the armor to do damage. Using a standardized script, Listen-Based-Armor greatly reduces the strain on SL’s physics engine and allows for much more dynamic systems of armor. There are variants such as LBA lite which takes damage from collision in addition to LBA weapons, and LBA-D which takes reduced damage depending on directionality to simulate variations in armor density. You may learn more about this complex topic from a knowledgeable scripter in the SLMC or from the following link: https://github.com/Krutchen/SLMCLBA
- **Pre-firing**: This is a common FPS tactic. Pre-firing is when you estimate when someone is about to round a corner and fire where you think they're about to appear. The minimap is the easiest tool to use for this.
- **Pre-jump**: The delay between pressing jump and actually jumping. This simulates needing to crouch before springing into the air. Disabling this delay is considered by some to be a client-side assist or cheat.
- **Prim jump**: This is when you combine a jump with the upward motion of stepping up onto a prim, taking advantage of SL's physics system, for a huge boost in jump height. This takes practice to learn the timing. Prim jumping is generally considered acceptable within the SLMC.
- **Prim shooting**: This is when you shoot someone through a wall. Due to Second Life's notoriously unoptimized physics engine, bullets do not always stop on impact with a wall and will keep going for a moment. Accidents happen, but doing this intentionally is considered cheating.
- **Raycast/RC**: This is a scripting feature in Second Life. Very simplified, in the context of a weapon, it means that rather than launching a projectile with the physics engine, the weapon uses a beam or "ray" to detect what the weapon is pointed at and moves an object to that location. This happens almost instantly whereas the speed limit of a projectile in Second Life is approximately 200 m/s. As such, it is sometimes considered a more powerful kind of weapon. Some weapons such as snipers or shotguns may use multiple rays at once to form a detection cone rather than a pinpoint. This is a complex topic and you can learn more from a scripter or from http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlCastRay
- **Render Weight**: This is how hard someone's computer has to work to render your avatar. The harder one's computer must work, the fewer frames per second they get. In combat, frames per second are very important and a heavy use of resources can drag other people's combat experience down. Generally, the more complex your avatar, the higher its render weight (but not strictly). This is an extremely technical matter and you can find more information at http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Mesh/Rendering_weight 
- **Safe zone/spawn area**: In SLMC sims, your spawn point is usually contained within a safe zone where the opposing team is not permitted to enter during combat. Each group will define their own safe zone and protocol regarding it for both the defenders and the attackers. Intentionally entering the opposing safe zone is considered poor manners and will typically be responded to with force.
- **Space-barring**: The space bar allows you to hover in mid air or cancel a hard-fall. Some groups consider this a client-side assist or cheating.
